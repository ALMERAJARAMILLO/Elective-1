               <h1> My Testimonial</h1>
               <h2> I'm incredibly grateful for the opportunity to learn how to build a webpage today.  We created our own website from scratch, and I'm so proud of myself for following each step our professor teach us.  The final product turned out exactly as I expected. It might not that good as a pro but I was be able to do something even it's my first time. I'm especially happy that I was able to learn how to add background images and customize the font styles.  I even got to use my favorite colors and add text shadows, t's really personalizing my website. I'm incredibly grateful as well because I got the chance to learn how to use the vscode.

                There was one point where I got really stuck. I couldn't figure out how to change the background picture, when l click the services and resume of my website it doesn't connect with my code, and I was starting to get frustrated.  But I didn't give up! I kept trying different things, and finally, I found the solution.  It was a small detail I was missing, but once I figured it out, I felt so accomplished.  It was a reminder that even when things get tough, persistence pays off.
                
                Despite the challenges, I'm feeling really proud of myself for building this website. It's been a lot of work, but it's been so rewarding to see my vision come to life. I'm excited to keep learning and developing my skills.
                
                One of the coolest things I learned was how to use VS Code. It's a powerful tool for web developers.
                
                It was a long day, my brain was definitely tired from all the new stuff I learned. But I'm so happy!  The things I learned today are going to be really useful in the future.</h2>
