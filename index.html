               <h1>Get to know me</h1>
               <h2> Hello! I'm Mera Jaramillo,
                 a passionate Bachelor of Science in Information Technology (BSIT) student at
                  Northern Bukidnon State College.

                  With a strong commitment to academic excellence, 
                  I have consistently achieved Honor Student status and been recognized as a Dean's Lister. 

                  <h2> I believe that technology has the power to transform lives, and I'm excited to be part of that transformation. 
                  My studies have provided me with a solid foundation in programming, web development, and database management.

                   <h2> I love creating user-friendly websites and applications that make everyday tasks easier and more efficient. 
                   Beyond the classroom, I actively seek opportunities to apply my skills through internships and personal projects.

                 <h2> My journey in the tech world is driven by a curiosity for innovation and a desire to solve real-world problems through technology. 

                  When I’m not immersed in coding or studying, you can find me exploring new hiking trails, 
                  capturing moments through photography, or diving into the latest tech trends. 
                  Join me as I share my experiences, skills, and aspirations on this journey!
